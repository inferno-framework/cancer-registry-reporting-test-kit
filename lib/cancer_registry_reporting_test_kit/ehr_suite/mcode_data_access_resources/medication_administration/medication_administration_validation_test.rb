    title 'MedicationAdministration resources returned during previous tests conform to the mCODE Cancer-Related Medication Administration Profile'
    description %(
        This test verifies resources returned from the first search conform to
        the [mCODE Cancer-Related Medication Administration Profile](https://hl7.org/fhir/us/mcode/STU3/StructureDefinition-mcode-cancer-related-medication-administration.html).
        Systems must demonstrate at least one valid example in order to pass this test.

        It verifies the presence of mandatory elements and that elements with
        required bindings contain appropriate values. CodeableConcept element
        bindings will fail if none of their codings have a code/system belonging
        to the bound ValueSet. Quantity, Coding, and code element bindings will
        fail if their code/system are not found in the valueset.
